# 🐐 AIGoat — AI-Generated Vulnerable Application Prompt

**AIGoat** is a companion project inspired by [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), but adapted for the age of AI-assisted development. Instead of distributing vulnerable code directly, AIGoat provides a natural-language prompt that instructs AI coding agents (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, CodeWhisperer, etc.) to generate a vulnerable application from scratch.

This allows users to explore and test how AI agents can accidentally introduce insecure patterns, and how modern security tools like **Mobb Vibe Shield (MVS)** can detect and fix them.

## 💡 Purpose & Intent

The purpose of AIGoat is educational and demonstrative:

- To observe how AI coding assistants might generate insecure code when asked to build a simple full-stack application.
- To evaluate whether AI-generated code includes known classes of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, insecure session handling).
- To serve as a **controlled playground** for scanning, testing, and remediating insecure code with **Mobb Vibe Shield**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The vulnerabilities generated by this prompt are intentional. Do not deploy the generated application in production environments.

## 📥 Prompt (Feed this to your AI coding assistant)

Copy and paste the following into your IDE-based AI agent (e.g., Copilot or Cursor) to generate the vulnerable Flask application:
